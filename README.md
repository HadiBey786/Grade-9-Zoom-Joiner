Join all your Zoom classes as soon as they start - never be late again!

This script will run in the background and automatically join all the classes two minutes before they start every weekday.

These files are made using the timings and links for RISE Academy Grade 9. To edit the timings and links, please download the files and edit locally.

To install, clone the file to your computer, then double-click zoom.pyw and once opened click Run (Python 3 must be installed on your computer). The links will only be opened while the script is running.
